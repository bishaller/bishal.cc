                <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹</p>
                <p>
                  My name is Bishal. I am a UX &amp; Product Designer, who turns
                  complex problem sets to simple solutions, focused to build
                  experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I can Think, Solve, Invent, Design, Code, Manage, Lead and
                  most importantly, Learn. I have worn many hats, but currently
                  I lead all things product(s) and team(s) at Last Door, a B2B
                  Design and Development agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am passionate about all areas of Design and Marketing. Being
                  a business studies graduate helps me blend the business side
                  with Design and make decisions as a product lead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As of april 2022, I am learning to code and be consistent with
                  it, which also sums up the in-progress version of my personal
                  site. Besides that, I'm a fun person to hang around. You can
                  find me on any social media with @bishaller username. Or,
                  let's just connect on linkedin.
