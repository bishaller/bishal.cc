                  <h2>Here's more about me & the work I do.</h2>
                  <p>
                    I started as an intern designer watching photoshop and
                    illustrator tutorials in 2015. I've worn many hats, from
                    illustrating maps, trying hard on graphic design,
                    transforming to a UI designer, understanding and grinding on
                    UX, learning to code, and managing products and teams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Clutching knowledge from every aspect of design, product,
                    marketing, development, and management, I am an end-to-end
                    designer who believes in building experiences that create an
                    impact rather than "just functional." I can Think, Solve,
                    Invent, Design, Code, Manage, Lead, and, most importantly,
                    Learn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have worked on projects as small as changing a tertiary
                    button color to designing large-scale applications requiring
                    an extensive design system. I can fit in most teams,
                    bridging teams or being an individual contributor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though I'm a designer, I like exploring horizontals and
                    scratching my head to understand how my peer work to bring
                    products to life. Being a marketing student in my undergrad,
                    a UX student in my master's, and a coding student at night,
                    I enjoy learning.
