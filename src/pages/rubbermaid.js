Sharing progress and findings became an opportunity to tell the story of our users, integrating their experiences and feedback into the evolution of the project. Every adjustment was a thoughtful response to fundamental human needs, making each step feel like a collaborative journey with the community.

            <p>In my research for launching Rubbermaid's e-commerce shop, I discovered a significant gap in consumer awareness. Despite Rubbermaid's strong sales on major platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and Target, many users must know the brand's extensive range beyond kitchen products. My findings also highlighted a general indifference towards Rubbermaid's social media efforts, though there's a positive note: some customers are interested in exploring Rubbermaid's other offerings. In physical retail environments, Rubbermaid enjoys prominent placement, capturing consumer attention at eye level across stores, which has undeniably contributed to its solid performance. This research has clarified that our upcoming online store must showcase Rubbermaid's entire product catalog and engage with our customers more effectively, enhancing their awareness and interest in the broader Rubbermaid brand.</p>

              Rubbermaid has been selling its products traditionally and
              needs an online e-commerce shop. They have excellent
              performance in giants like Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc., but
              have yet to have an online store of their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              The brand currently relies on one specific category, i.e.,
              food containers. However, when we interviewed the users, we
              learned that they were more than happy to buy other products
              from Rubbermaid but had yet to know what Rubbermaid sold
              outside of food containers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The products Rubbermaid sells revolve around more of what they
              want to sell rather than what the users need.

            <p>
              I am solving a specific use case where I am taking up a user trying to set up their apartment or any household category from scratch. However, this solution would still cater to users who have not decided what household items they need to organize their homes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I designed an app for Rubbermaid to let users find the perfect match of home organizational products they need. The users would sign up, select categories, and swipe through cards. Each card would show the items in specific categories; ideally, each would have 30-45 cards. So the users would swipe right for the things they have or will have in their home and swipe left if not, while users would also have options to custom-add the items not shown in the card. When the user is done swiping, the app suggests a list of products they need to organize all the items in their home or a specific category.

            <p>
              For the first round, I ran down the hall test with a couple of
              friends with my sketches. I realized that all items won't go
              in the same card swipes and had to introduce "categories" so
              that the users could minimize the swiping experience and
              choose to narrow their product search.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a few more paper tests with the Rubbermaid users (that
              match the persona), I moved ahead with the UI and tested that
              with 7 more users. Some were the same, and I chose some new
              users to test the UI. I found out that the "Where am I?" state
              in the card swipes was confusing for the users, and I opted to
              choose the Instagram story style indicator for more relevancy.
