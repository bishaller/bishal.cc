                  The brand currently relies on one specific category, i.e.,
                  food containers. However, when we interviewed the users, we
                  learned that they were more than happy to buy other products
                  from Rubbermaid but had yet to know what Rubbermaid sold
                  outside of food containers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The products Rubbermaid sells revolve around more of what they
                  want to sell rather than what the users need.

                  I am solving a specific use case where I am taking up a user
                  trying to set up their apartment or any household category
                  from scratch. However, this solution would still cater to
                  users who have not decided what household items they need to
                  organize their homes.

                  I designed an app for Rubbermaid to let users find the perfect
                  match of home organizational products they need. The users
                  would sign up, select categories, and swipe through cards.
                  Each card would show the items in specific categories;
                  ideally, each would have 30-45 cards. So the users would swipe
                  right for the things they have or will have in their home and
                  swipe left if not, while users would also have options to
                  custom-add the items not shown in the card. When the user is
                  done swiping, the app suggests a list of products they need to
                  organize all the items in their home or a specific category.

                <p>
                  For the first round, I ran down the hall test with a couple of
                  friends with my sketches. I realized that all items won't go
                  in the same card swipes and had to introduce "categories" so
                  that the users could minimize the swiping experience and
                  choose to narrow their product search.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a few more paper tests with the Rubbermaid users (that
                  match the persona), I moved ahead with the UI and tested that
                  with 7 more users. Some were the same, and I chose some new
                  users to test the UI. I found out that the "Where am I?" state
                  in the card swipes was confusing for the users, and I opted to
                  choose the Instagram story style indicator for more relevancy.

                <p>
                  To make this product successful, card swiping should use
                  machine learning to understand users' demographics and
                  behavior. By doing so, we can predict users' household items
                  and show the cards accordingly.
