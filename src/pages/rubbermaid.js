                  Rubbermaid has been selling its products traditionally and
                  needs an online e-commerce shop. They have excellent
                  performance in giants like Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc., but
                  have yet to have an online store of their own.

                  Rubbermaid has been selling its products traditionally and
                  needs an online e-commerce shop. They have excellent
                  performance in giants like Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc., but
                  have yet to have an online store of their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The brand currently relies on one specific category, i.e.,
                  food containers. However, when we interviewed the users, we
                  learned that they were more than happy to buy other products
                  from Rubbermaid but had yet to know what Rubbermaid sold
                  outside of food containers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The products Rubbermaid sells revolve around more of what they
                  want to sell rather than what the users need.

                <p>
                  I am solving a specific use case where I am taking up a user
                  trying to set up their apartment or any household category
                  from scratch. However, this solution would still be able to
                  cater to all those users who have yet to decide what to buy to
                  organize their homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Let the users swipe right or left to find the right fit of
                  household items."
                </p>
                <p>
                  I designed an app for Rubbermaid to let users find the perfect
                  match of home organizational products they need. The users
                  would sign up, select categories, and swipe through cards.
                  Each card would show the items in specific categories;
                  ideally, each would have 30-45 cards. So the users would swipe
                  right for the things they have or will have in their home and
                  swipe left if not, while users would also have options to
                  custom-add the items not shown in the card. When the user is
                  done swiping, the app suggests a list of products that the
                  user needs to organize all the items in their home or a
                  specific category.
